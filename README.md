# CPU Scheduler

A simple CPU scheduler simulator that runs with different algorithms, specifically
- FCFS - First Come, First Serve
- SJF - Shortest Job First
- Round Robin
- Priority Scheduling

For each algorithm, processes are sorted accordingly in the process table. For instance, by arriveTime for FCFS and by arriveTime and burstTime for SJF algorithms.
